## Build log:       

02/05/23:       

Basic setup on backend: local copy reverted to original, cloned version. Dependencies installed, .env file checked, test route checked ok, terminal reading ok.     

Frontend directory set up, `create-react-app` run, unneccessary default files/code deleted. **MaterialUI** installed and basic Header, Body and Footer components templated out. `body` margin set to `0px` in `index.css` to remove white border around app.       

Footer icons and positioning updated. Header updated and stripped back.     

**React Router** installed and implemented. Components added for Home, Index and Add. Navigation user footer tabs added: n.b. - if user manually navigates to a route, the tabs do not update accordingly at present.      

## To add / to-do:      
- MUI theming: need to look at the documentation in more detail and/or find a decent tutorial for this.     
- Footer nav icons do not update correctly if user manually navigates to a path.
